# swiftdocs

SwiftDocs is a VSCode extension that makes it easier for development teams to document their code.

It's currently a work in progress, which means that many of the core features are yet to be built.

## Features

The extension currently allows users to highlight a piece of code and annotate it, which in doing so adds it to a "Wiki".

The goal is that Wikis will be written to a teams.json file which can be version controlled.

The extension will also need to track changes to any files mentioned in a wiki, so that the lines referenced are also updated.

## Release Notes

#### v0.0.1

Initial transfer from Bitbucket.
